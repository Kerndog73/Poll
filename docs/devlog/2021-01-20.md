It's about time I did the results page. Like I said yesterday, I'll start with
the categorical results page. It just occurred to me that for numerical results,
a box plot could do.

The styling for the categorical results page is complete. It's pretty much what
I described in the design. There's a title at the top, then the histogram is
made up of rows with each row having the total count, the percent, the name and
a bar. I made this cool effect where the name is inside the bar and the color of
the text is inverted. It's hard to explain but it's in the screenshot and I
think it looks pretty cool.

Now I have the results page being rendered by the server. It's time to move onto
the numerical results page. I really don't think it would make sense to draw a
histogram. I'm thinking maybe a boxplot as a nice generic way of representing
numerical data. That or just show the numbers. Yeah I think I'll just show a
table of numbers.

Going to the results page should close the poll. I can probably do this quite
simply by closing the poll in the `GET /results` handler. Closing the poll will
prevent any more responses from being submitted. The user should also be told
when the poll will be deleted. Perhaps I could put a date on the run page.

For the run page, perhaps I don't need to make the QR code as big as possible. I
could add a button that makes it occupy the full window. Or I could just leave
zooming to the end user.

The run page now looks more similar to the other pages. The QR code is still
very big but the page looks much better now.

At this point, the project is pretty much done. Tomorrow I'll spend some time
cleaning up the the code. There's a few duplicated snippets around and a handful
of things I'd like to fix up.
