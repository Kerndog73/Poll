I was planning to start working on categorical polls today. As I said yesterday,
I've got some things happening today so I won't have as much time as usual.
I guess I'll just see what I can get done.

I think I'll start with the configuration page.

It seems to work pretty well. I had a pretty clear vision of how it would work.
Text boxes are created and destroyed as necessary depending on whether they're
empty. I also needed to manage the `required` attribute to ensure that at least
two boxes are not empty. To ensure that no empty boxes are sent, the `name`
attribute has to be set and unset as necessary.

I made a start on the response page. I didn't setup the templating code but just
created an example. Finalizing the response page is going to require the backend
for the configuration page. That's what I'll work on tomorrow because today I'm
out of time.
