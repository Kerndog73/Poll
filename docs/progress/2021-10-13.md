Today's the day. I'm starting the new project. It's going to be a simple polling
website. I already have a few ideas jotted down. Today I'm probably just going
to be working on the design. I'll try to figure out every detail I can before I
start programming. Hopefully my experience with the previous project will make
designing this one easier.

It occurred to me that this might be an original idea. There are survey websites
out there sure, but I don't think there are many survey websites with this goal
in mind.

The design is pretty detailed at this point. It's probably detailed enough to
get started. I think I'll try and write a task list as well.

I really thought this was an original idea until I found
[this](https://www.poll-maker.com/). Oh well. I didn't design this project
knowing that I was copying someone else. It just so happens that someone else
has done the same thing before me. This is an improvement over the last project
where I was knowingly copying someone else.

I'm quite proud of how detailed the design is. It's much more detailed than the
design for the last project. There are still a lot of details that I'll need to
figure out once I start writing code.
